VeWorld Wallet Opener
A simple tool to open the VeWorld Wallet in your browser with a button. This project contains one HTML file with a button that tries to connect to the VeWorld Wallet (a Web3 wallet for the VeChainThor blockchain).

What You Need
Browser : Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
VeWorld Wallet : Install the VeWorld extension in your browser.
Optional: A local web server (e.g., Python) if you have issues with file:// URLs.
How to Use
Download the code:
Click "Download ZIP" or clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/10A0A/veworld-wallet-opener.git

Install the VeWorld extension from the Chrome Web Store.
Ensure the extension is enabled (chrome://extensions/).
Start a local web server (recommended):

python -m http.server 8000

Open the page in your browser:

http://localhost:8000/index.html

Click the "Open VeWorld Wallet" button.
If the wallet is installed, a pop-up should appear asking for connection confirmation.
Note : Opening the index.html file directly may not work in some browsers due to security restrictions.

Troubleshooting
Wallet doesnâ€™t open?
Make sure the VeWorld extension is installed and enabled.
Open the browser console (F12 â†’ Console) and check for errors.
Use a local web server instead of file://.
No response when clicking?
Ensure the file is loaded via http://localhost.
Limitations
May not work with local files (file://).
The wallet must support window.vechain or window.ethereum.
Customization
To use a specific DApp page, modify the openVeWorld function in index.html:

javascript

window.location.href = 'https://example-dapp.com'; // Replace with your DApp URL
